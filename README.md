# FAILURE-PREDICTION-IN-INDUSTRIAL-MACHINERY-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-ALGORITHMS-
This project focuses on predicting mechanical failures in industrial machines using advanced machine learning algorithms. By analyzing sensor and operational data, the system identifies potential breakdowns before they occur  enabling predictive maintenance, reducing downtime, and improving overall efficiency.
